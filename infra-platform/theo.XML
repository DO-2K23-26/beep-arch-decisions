  weave

</Solution>
<Rationale>
 From personal experiences and docs, I know that weave
 <LinkWeave>
  https://github.com/rajch/weave#using-weave-on-kubernetes
 </LinkWeave>
 is the simplest CNI to install and manage that also fits our use case:
 <OurUseCase>
  Setting up Network Policies
 </OurUseCase>
  I believe Linkerd and our own observability stack would be sufficient to monitor the apps and network, so that we don't need baked-in observability from the CNI,
  nor features such as eBPF,
  and that we wish to keep overhead of the resource consuption to a minimum,
  all the while not having to actively manage the CNI, or spend lots of efforts setting it up properly.
  These could happen if we use Cillium or Calico. They are great, but too complex for our use. I believe Weave is complete for us.
  If we ever need another CNI, we can swap it or chain it. But I doubt we will for now.
