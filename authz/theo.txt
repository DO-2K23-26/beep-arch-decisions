= Authorization

Suggested solution: AuthZed

== Rationale

We have gone through lots of other solutions such as OPA, Keycloak, Permify, our own systems... There are differences in the DSLanguage, usability/ease of deployment, scalability..

I believe AuthZed to be the most balanced solution in terms of ease of use, development of authz rules, and integration with our apps; as well as deployment.
