= Our migroservices

- Users
- Authentication (FTLOG not Keycloak)
- Communities
- Authorization (AuthZed)
- Messaging
- Files
- Calls
- The K8s API Gateway, with HTTPRoutes to route each backend path to the correct service.

== Rationale

Grouping very interdependant ("tightly-coupled") business domains (user services the app provides - which I identified through user stories). The idea being to reap some of the benefits of a microservices architecture, without getting too complex.

Using the K8s API Gateway as the gateway, I make use of an existing, well-designed mechanism that's proven to work well, and to separate the concerns of developers, operators and infrastructure owners thorougly.
